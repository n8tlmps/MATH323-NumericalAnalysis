# Numerical Analysis

## Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation
Interpolation and polynomial approximation estimate unknown values from known data points, allowing for more accurate predictions and data analysis. These techniques help in modeling complex relationships and handling noisy data, thereby improving the robustness and performance of machine learning models.

## Numerical Integration
Numerical integration considers approximating integrals of one or two variables.The Composite Simpson's rule was easy to use and produced accurate approximations unless the function oscillated in a subinterval of the interval of integration. Gaussian quadrature gave us the ability to minimize the number of nodes while maintaining accuracy.

## Initial-Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations
Initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to model dynamic systems where the future state depends on both the current state and its rate of change, enabling the simulation of complex behaviors over time. These problems are particularly relevant in areas such as reinforcement learning and neural network training, where they can help optimize trajectories and improve model performance by capturing temporal dependencies.

## Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems
Direct methods for solving linear systems are used for efficiently solving equations that arise during model training and optimization. These methods are crucial for tasks such as linear regression, where they help compute the optimal coefficients quickly by solving the normal equations derived from the data.

## Solutions of Equations in One Variable
Solutions of equations in one variable facilitate optimization processes, such as minimizing loss functions, and help in establishing relationships between variables in regression models. They also provide theoretical foundations for various algorithms and enhance the interpretability of model results.
